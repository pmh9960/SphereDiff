> **Abstract:**
> _The increasing demand for AR/VR applications has highlighted the need for high-quality 360-degree panoramic content.
> However, generating high-quality 360-degree panoramic images and videos remains a challenging task due to the severe
> distortions introduced by equirectangular projection (ERP). Existing approaches either fine-tune pretrained
> diffusion models on limited ERP datasets or attempt tuning-free methods that still rely on ERP latent
> representations, leading to discontinuities near the poles. In this paper, we introduce SphereDiff, a novel approach
> for seamless 360-degree panoramic image and video generation using state-of-the-art diffusion models without
> additional tuning. We define a spherical latent representation that ensures uniform distribution across all
> perspectives, mitigating the distortions inherent in ERP. We extend MultiDiffusion to spherical latent space and
> propose a spherical latent sampling method to enable direct use of pretrained diffusion models. Moreover, we
> introduce distortion-aware weighted averaging to further improve the generation quality in the projection process.
> Our method outperforms existing approaches in generating 360-degree panoramic content while maintaining high
> fidelity, making it a robust solution for immersive AR/VR applications._
